[2025-06-19 15:23:30] - Successfully fixed Google provider 404 error - URL construction corrected for custom base URL

[2025-06-19 15:34:51] - Fixed OpenRouter provider 404 error by updating model from "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free" to "mistralai/devstral-small:free" in mathAgent example

[2025-06-19 16:01:15] - **CONFIGURATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED**: Successfully made all hardcoded values configurable through environment variables and runtime configuration. Created comprehensive configuration system with support for API keys, base URLs, models, timeouts, and other parameters.

[2025-06-19 16:06:52] - **SECURITY ENHANCEMENT**: Removed all hardcoded API keys from default configuration fallbacks. API keys now must be provided via environment variables (.env file) only, improving security posture and eliminating exposure of sensitive credentials in source code.

[2025-06-19 17:34:26] - **README Overhaul**: Updated `README.md` with new repository URL, accurate directory structure, and revised code examples reflecting the latest configuration and API.
